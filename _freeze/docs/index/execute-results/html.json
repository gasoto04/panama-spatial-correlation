A recent BBC interview with Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang, for example, highlighted this as a factor behind his decision to relocate the capital city:\n\n> It's the remoteness of Oyala that makes it so appealing to President Obiang. In a rare interview he described how rebels had recently plotted a seaborne assault on his palace in the current capital, Malabo. 'We need a secure place for my government and for future governments. That's why we have created Oyala, to guarantee the government of Equatorial Guinea.' [@sackur_equatorial_2012]\n\nThis case is far from exceptional, as an even more recent *Washington Post* article points out with respect to Myanmar's decision to move its capital from Yangon to Naypyidaw:\n\n> Analysts have described the decision as motivated by a desire to secure the militaryâ€™s seat of power from any threat of protests or invasions. [@berger_myanmars_2021]\n\nMost of these studies, however, are based on observations of **conflict events**. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital's distance from the **population centroid** of the country.\n\n## Literature Review\n\n@campante_capital_2019 analyzes the relationship between the location of a **capital city** and the degree of conflict and misgovernance in a given country. Their two key findings are that:\n\n> Conflict is more likely to emerge (and dislodge incumbents) closer to the capital\n\nand\n\n> Isolated capitals are associated with misgovernance.\n\nThis first finding is illustrated in @fig-conflict-dist\n\n![](images/conflict_dist.svg){#fig-conflict-dist}\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe **population centroids** we use herein might require some explanation, since the term \"centroid\" can be ambiguous.\n\nHere, the population centroids are drawn from @hall_population_2019\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nHere we plot the base GIS objects we're analyzing: the location of each **capital city** (in purple) and each **population centroid** (in yellow).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#| label: imports\nlibrary(tidyverse) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(sf) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(mapview) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'mapview' was built under R version 4.4.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#| label: imports\nlibrary(units) |> suppressPackageStartupMessages()\ncb_palette <- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#| label: load-eda\n#merged_long_sf <- readRDS(\"merged_long_sf.rds\")\n#mapview(merged_long_sf, zcol=\"name\", cex=4, label=\"geounit\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then construct an **area-normalized** measure of capital-centroid distance $\\text{dist}^{\\textsf{AN}}$, using the formula\n\n$$\n\\text{dist}^{\\textsf{AN}}_i = \\text{dist}_i / \\sqrt{\\text{area}_i}.\n$$\n\nA plot of this measure by country looks as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#| label: plot-area\n#merged_area_sf <- readRDS(\"merged_area_sf.rds\")\n#mapview(merged_area_sf, zcol=\"scaled_dist\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Hypothesis Testing (Regression)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#| label: plot-regression\n#merged_sub_sf <- readRDS(\"merged_sub_sf.rds\")\n#merged_sub_sf |> head()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#merged_sub_sf |> ggplot(aes(x=scaled_dist, y=total_score, label=NAME_ENGLI)) +\n#  geom_point() +\n#  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x) +\n#  geom_text(size=4, nudge_y = 0.075) +\n#  theme_classic()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur evidence indicates that the spatial dynamics of **conflict** differ from the spatial dynamics of **misgovernance**.
